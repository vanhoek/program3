Functional errors:
- Modified line 39, changed score1<score2 operator to score1<=score2
- Modified line 44, modified use score3 instead of score2, score2 is the lowest in that condition
- Modified line 49 and line 50 from integers of 99 to score1 and score2. All 3 scores have the same value.
- Modified line 59, removed "args==null ||" condition, it cannot be null since it's been initialized
